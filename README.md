# Gesture Virtual Keyboard

Gesture Virtual Keyboard is an AI/ML-based project that uses real-time hand gesture recognition to simulate keyboard input.  
By leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning models, the system detects hand landmarks via a webcam and maps them to virtual keystrokes.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe  
- Gesture-based virtual keyboard input  
- Accurate hand landmark detection  
- Works completely with Python  
- No physical keyboard required for basic input  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Mediapipe**
- **NumPy**
